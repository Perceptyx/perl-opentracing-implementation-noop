=head1 NAME

OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp - Stops Crashing, doing nothing else



=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp;
    
    my $tracer = OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp->bootstrap( );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The NoOp Implementation will 'disable' the entire OpenTracing infrastructure by
making almost every method do nothing, or return a 'NoOp' object.

This way, none of the code will break if there is no OpenTracing active.

This implementation does not rely on L<OpenTracing::Role>, because those already
add attributes and methods that are totally useless in this context of a 'NoOp'.



=head1 CLASS METHODS



=head2 bootstrap

    my $tracer = OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp->bootstrap( @extra_args );

Returns a L<OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer> compliant tracer, using the
L<OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp::Tracer> implementation.

Any arguments passed in, and dutyfully passed, but are supposedly useless.
